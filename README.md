Software Development Lifecycle Class
In this class we worked with projects that used Java coding and learned to create jar files. 
We also learned about the importance of agile methodology

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  It is important to always understand and gather as many requirements as you can before developing software. User stories help to get a better understanding
  in a customer's own words about what they would like the software to do and helps get a better idea of how to create a program that will give them a 
  satisfactory experience.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I approach developing programs with a good understanding of what I need to create. I make sure to ask a lot of questions and clarify what is being asked
  of me. I hope to incorporate daily scrum meetings as well as Azure boards in my future development. I use them now and feel they work really well. It 
  helps a team to always be on the same page and gives ample opportunity for improved communication.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  A good team member I think first has to always remember that they are part of a team. It means having good communication with each other and always
  ensuring having an open and positive environment. It also means speaking up when there are any issues and making sure that work is being 
  delegated appropriately. It is important to not keep taking on tasks and feeling overwhelmed and not saying anything because this can easily lead to 
  burn out. A team needs to have the capability of helping each other, providing feedback, and trying their best to always stay on task and on the same
  page throughout the development of a project.
